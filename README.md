# SpotC++
This is my repo for compiled Spotilife + Sposify IPAs. Spotilife is a Spotify IOS app tweak that removes ads, removes limited skips, and almost every other premium feature. The only main premium feature that does not work is offline downloads, as this is done server-side. Sposify is a Spotify IOS app tweak that adds various enhancements to the Spotify IOS application.

## Adding to AltStore/SideStore<br/>
You can add my repo to AltStore *Beta* or SideStore for automatic updates and conviniance, by following the steps below:<br/>
1. Tap "Sources" in the top-right corner of the Browse tab.<br/>
2. Tap the ”+” button and add my source by entering its URL "https://tiny.one/SpotC"
3. Now SpotC++ and any other "SpotC" Apps will show up in AltStore/SideStore under the "Browse" tab where you can install and update my apps easily from within AltStore/SideStore.<br/>

## How it's Made<br/>
I post a new release everytime their is an Spotilife/Sposify Update, or there is a new major Spotify update that is compatible with both the latest Spotilife, and the latest Sposify. I get the vanilla Spotify IPA from IOS God's [Decrypted AppStore](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us/spotify) or from green verified links on [AppDB](https://appdb.to/app/ios/324684580), I will specify details on each realease page. Then I download the latest Spotilife .deb from Julio's repo [here](https://julio.hackyouriphone.org), and the latest Sposify .deb from The Dynastic repo [here](https://repo.dynastic.co/package/com.spos). I download both using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload). I then inject the .deb's into the Spotify IPA using [Sidloadly](https://sideloadly.io) I do not do anything else to the IPA (Unless otherwise specified in the release notes)... However please note that theoretically, IOSGod's decrypted app store could insert malware, same with Sideloadly, cydownload, julio's tweak, and aesthyrica's tweak. These are, however, either considered trusted by the community and/or Open-Source. This is use at your own risk, and I am not responsible for *ANY* damage.

Version Format is *SpotC++ Version*\_*Spotify Version*<br/>
Ex. *v1.3.6*\_*v8.7.78*<br/>
